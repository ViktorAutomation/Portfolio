# FB & LinkedIn Auto-posting System Using Custom GPT Action

## Project Overview
This project involved developing Custom GPT actions integrated with Make.com to automate social media posting. It streamlines content curation, creation, posting processes, and management into a single seamless workflow.

## Problem & Goals
The goal was to automate the manual process of finding relevant news articles, curating content, publishing posts on Facebook and LinkedIn directly through a single GPT conversation, and tracking successful posts, improving efficiency and consistency.

## Solution & Implementation
- **Custom GPT actions** were created to trigger Make.com scenarios.
- Make.com scenarios parse specified websites for the latest news articles and deliver curated content directly back into the GPT conversation.
- Users select and edit content within GPT before it gets published automatically on chosen social media platforms.
- Integrated the ability to post on Facebook pages either using the original article image or generating a new, engaging image through OpenAI's DALL-E 3 module within the same scenario.
- Successfully posted content is recorded and saved automatically in an Airtable base for easy tracking and analytics.
- A fully integrated, single-conversation workflow handles all steps from content curation to posting and reporting.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- GPT (Custom GPT Actions)
- Make.com (Integromat)
